                <h5>Student & Fornt-end Developer</h5>
                <p>Hello! I'm Akash Sahu, a passionate and driven college student on a mission to make a meaningful impact in
                    the world through Programming/Coding.
                    I am currently pursuing in B.E. 2nd Year at Institute of Engineering and Technology , Khandari Agra(Dr. Bhim
                    Rao Ambedkar University, Agar), where I have been fortunate to explore diverse subjects such as Computer
                    Science Student.
                    Throughout my college journey, I have actively sought opportunities to gain practical experience. I had the
                    privilege of interning at my college, where I worked on Class Representative(CR) post and honed my technical
                    skill(Programming language). Additionally, my involvement in Coding Club allowed me to collaborate with a
                    diverse team and develop my leadership and communication abilities.
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I have developed proficiency in C,C++, Java,
                    Python,HTML,CSS,JS,SQL,Data Structure,DBMS. Moreover, my college experience has sharpened my ability to
                    communicate complex ideas effectively, adapt to changing situations, and work collaboratively in team
                    environments.
                    Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to Creative visionary. I am particularly passionate about my programming
                    and aim to contribute to Technological innovation for societal progress. I am committed to lifelong learning
                    and plan to pursue further education and certifications to stay at the forefront of industry trends and
                    innovations.
                    When I'm not immersed in my studies or pursuing professional endeavors, you'll often find me Competitive
                    programming. These activities not only provide me with a much-needed balance but also fuel my creativity and
                    ability to approach challenges from different perspectives.
